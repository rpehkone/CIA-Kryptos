Design Criteria, October 1987, Philosophy:
    This art should reflect life in all its positive aspects (e.g., truth, justice, courage, liberty, etc.).
    It should engender feelings of well being, hope, promise, and such. It should not produce or reflect negative attitudes,
    political expressions, or feelings of futility. The art should respect sensitivities against sexual, sexist, race, ethic,
    or other related slurs. It must also be compatible with the special security needs of the institution.
